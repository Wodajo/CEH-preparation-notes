- Update chapters with new tools (`ncrack`, `john` and `netcat`)

Wierd:

- some problem with executing ncrack dict attack on telnet.  
`sudo ncrack -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_users_for_services_unhash.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_pass_for_services_unhash.txt 10.0.2.5 -p 23`
- `iwctl` has problems with connecting to home router, but doesn't with hot spot (arch installation)
