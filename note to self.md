Gods of Perseverance, Systematicness and Conscientiousness have me in your keep

- `netcat`
- It seems like kernel is reassembling my fragmented segments - bypass this
- Finish DNS notes & configure your own DNS (on arch)  
  

- remeber to `uniq` your dictionaries
- It would be good to first look for users to enumerate (ftp, ssh, telnet...)
otherwise - list is too long


Wierd:
- some problem with executing ncrack dict attack on telnet.  
`sudo ncrack -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_users_for_services_unhash.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_pass_for_services_unhash.txt 10.0.2.5 -p 23`
seems like `telnet` is unstable

- `iwctl` has problems with connecting to home router, but doesn't with hot spot (arch installation)
