- Gods of Perseverance, Systematicness and Conscientiousness have me in your keep

- Update chapters with further tools (`ncrack`, `john`, `hashcat`, `netcat`)  
- It seems like kernel is reassembling my fragmented segments - bypass this
- continue to enumerate M1 and M2
- Finish DNS notes & configure your own DNS (on arch)  


- remeber to uniq your dictionaries



Wierd:
- some problem with executing ncrack dict attack on telnet.  
`sudo ncrack -U /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_users_for_services_unhash.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/default_pass_for_services_unhash.txt 10.0.2.5 -p 23`
- `iwctl` has problems with connecting to home router, but doesn't with hot spot (arch installation)
