In IPv6 there is massive amounts of possible IP addresses - bruteforce scanning would take a lot of time. Think how to scan a network using only IPv6.
It would be best to first look for proven IPv6 addresses in e.g. traffic ,emails, logs...

Describe how are protocols used in scans (new file)

Test hping scans dynamics with home made GNS3 network (especially packet crafting)

By issuing the --packet-trace command, Nmap sends some packets to the intended machine and receives packets in response to the sent packets. It prints a summary of every packet it sends and receives.
-> I want to analyse/do sth like this

Divide and describe scans based on: tool (tool.md), protocol (scan-types.md), type with info about detection evasion, firewall bypasiing and such (scan-sneakyness.md)
