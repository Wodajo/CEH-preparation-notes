In IPv6 there is massive amounts of possible IP addresses - bruteforce scanning would take a lot of time. Think how to scan a network using only IPv6.
It would be best to first look for proven IPv6 addresses in e.g. traffic ,emails, logs...

Describe how are protocols used in scans (new file)

Test hping scans dynamics with home made GNS3 network (especially packet crafting)


Divide and describe scans based on: tool (tool.md), protocol (scan-types.md), type with info about detection evasion, firewall bypasiing and such usnig i.a. IP spoofing, pck fragmentation (sneakyness.md) - in scenario of scanning from taken over machine is is good to know which scans doesn't require root.
