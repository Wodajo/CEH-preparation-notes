With my 32BG of RAM I can create e.g. 5 targtets with 4GB of RAM and 8GB attacking VM. 4GB are left for host OS.  
We'll see if I have enough CPU.  
Create NAT network in VirtualBox. For now targets are Win10, Win11, Xubuntu, Kali and Metasploitable2.  
**I'd like to see firewalls in action** - that will be project 2  

# Project 1
Attacker and Targets are in the same LAN  
What I want?:  
- try to discover every host on a subnet
- try to scan ports on active hosts
- try banner grabbing of active hosts and their open ports
- prepare a raport (For now - markdown on github. Later think about exporting joplin/cherrytree or sth like this)
- sniff whole traffic in wireshark on attacking machine for later analysis

# Project 2
Attacker and Targets in the same LAN  
Test fw options and fw bypassing:  

# Project 3
Attacker on another network. Try to do nat splitting
